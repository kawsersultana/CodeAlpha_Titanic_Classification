# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is a machine learning classification model aimed at predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. The model uses various classification algorithms to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, sex, class, and others.

## Project Overview

The Titanic Survival Prediction project uses various machine learning models to predict whether a passenger survived or not on the Titanic based on a variety of factors. The dataset is preprocessed, categorical variables are encoded, and different machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, XGBoost, SVM, Gradient Boosting, and more) are evaluated to determine the best classifier.

The project includes the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Categorical variables are encoded using `category_encoders` library, and the dataset is split into training and testing sets.
2. **Model Training**: Several machine learning models are trained, including:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Neural Network (MLPClassifier)
    - XGBoost
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    - Gradient Boosting
    - Random Forest
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    - Decision Tree
    - Naive Bayes
3. **Model Evaluation**: Each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Titanic dataset** from Kaggle. It contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, such as:

- `Pclass`: Passenger class (1, 2, 3)
- `Sex`: Gender (male/female)
- `Age`: Age of the passenger
- `SibSp`: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic
- `Parch`: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic
- `Fare`: Fare paid by the passenger
- `Embarked`: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
- `Survived`: Target variable (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

### Source

The dataset can be downloaded from the Kaggle Titanic competition [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: The project is implemented in Python.
- **Libraries**: 
    - Pandas
    - Scikit-learn
    - Category Encoders
    - XGBoost
    - Matplotlib
    - Seaborn

## Model Evaluation

Each model is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy Score**: The proportion of correct predictions.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A matrix that shows the classification results (true positives, true negatives, false positives, false negatives).
- **Classification Report**: Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for each class.
